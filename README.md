## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JayodyaNandasena/BurgershopWithDB.git
cd BurgershopWithDB
```

### 2. Set Up MySQL

1. Open your MySQL client (such as **MySQL Workbench**, **phpMyAdmin**, or terminal).
2. Run the following SQL to create the database and the required table:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE burgershop_db;
    USE burgershop_db;

    CREATE TABLE `customer` (
      `id` varchar(5) NOT NULL,
      `name` varchar(75) NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
    );

    CREATE TABLE `orders` (
      `id` varchar(5) NOT NULL,
      `status` enum('PREPARING','DELIVERED','CANCELLED') NOT NULL,
      `quantity` int NOT NULL,
      `value` double(7,2) NOT NULL,
      `customerId` varchar(5) NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
      KEY `customerId` (`customerId`),
      CONSTRAINT `orders_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`customerId`) REFERENCES `customer` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
    );
    ```

### 3. Configure Database Connection

Update your MySQL credentials in the `src/db/DBConnection.java`:

```java
private static final String USER = "your_mysql_username";
private static final String PASSWORD = "your_mysql_password";
```
Make sure:
- The MySQL server is running.
- The credentials are correct.
- The JDBC driver is properly added to your project dependencies (e.g., mysql-connector-java in your classpath).

### 4. Run the Application
1. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).
2. Build and run the main class (`src/Main.java`).
3. The Java Swing UI will launch and display the burger shop management system.

### 5. Usage Guide
1. Start with "Place Order" to create a new burger order.
2. Use the navigation to:
   - üì¶ **View Orders** by status: Preparing, Delivered, or Cancelled
   - ‚úèÔ∏è **Update Orders**: Modify burger quantity or change the order status (only for orders that are still Preparing)
   - üîç **Search** for specific orders or customers using their IDs
   - üèÜ **View Best Customers** ranked by their total purchase value

All data is persisted in the MySQL database.
